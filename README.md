## <ins>**Overview**</ins>

In this assignment, we are required to train a model which parses chess board images, for the purpose of detecting and analyzing the position of chess pieces on the corresponding board. We are given a preset data folder consisting of **250 chess board images** (125 clean and noisy images each, given in `./data/clean/capablanca` and `./data/noisy/capablanca/` respectively). The **first 100 images** (`001.jpg - 100.jpg`) in each folder are used as **data training labels** (represented in `boards.train.json`, used in `train.py`); whereas the **remaining 25 images** (`101.jpg - 125.jpg`) are used for **evaluation and testing** (represented in `boards.dev.json`, used in `evaluate.py`). Each image is **400x400 pixels** and each square is **50x50 pixels**, forming a 8x8 square chess board.

We are only allowed to modify `system.py`, in which the functions we're required to complete are **`classify`**, **`reduce_dimensions`**, **`process_training_data`**, **`classify_squares`** and **`classify_board`**. In addition, we are limited to **10 feature vectors**Â (**`N_DIMENSIONS = 10`**) for our classification system, and we are only allowed to use the default Python libraries alongside **numpy** and **scipy** packages.

As the given code already handles the file handling and initial processing steps (e.g. image input via **`load_square_images`** function in `utils.py` and conversion to feature vectors via **`image_to_feature_vectors`** function in `system.py`), we can proceed directly to the implementation of **`process_training_data`**.

## **<ins>Functions</ins>**

### <ins>1\. process\_training\_data</ins>

Using the default parameters (**`fvectors_train`** and **`labels_train`**), we can initialize a model dictionary containing the feature vectors and labels used for training. After running the feature vectors through the **reduce\_dimensions** function, we can update the model dictionary and return it for use in **train()**.

### <ins>2\. reduce\_dimensions</ins>

As suggested in the assignment brief, I have decided to implement the **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** unsupervised learning method for dimensionality reduction. I implemented my own PCA method mathematically using NumPy based on the formulae and steps detailed on the Wikipedia page regarding the method.

First, we have to calculate the empirical mean of the dataset, followed by the covariance matrix using the transposed data array. Then, we derive the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the covariance matrix and sort the eigenvectors in terms of descending eigenvalues. Next, we compute the principal components from the sorted eigenvectors up to N\_DIMENSIONS, and finally obtain the reduced dataset from the dot product between the matrices of the centred data array and principal components respectively.

Since the variance of principal components is cumulative, with each subsequent component always having less variance than the previous one (resembling an inverse-square graph), it is generally recommended to find an optimal amount of feature vector dimensions as a cut-off point (typically at **90-99% cumulative variance**). This effectively reduces the training time and processing power required, and negates the curse of dimensionality. However, as we are limited to only 10 dimensions in this assignment, we can infer hypothetically that it is nowhere near the 99% variance cut-off mark, hence I opted to pass the maximum amount of 10 feature vectors (`N_DIMENSIONS = 10`) into the reduce\_dimensions function, in order to obtain a score with the highest accuracy.

During my research, I have come across another algorithm/model known as **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)** which claims to have higher classification accuracy compared to PCA, as it is a **supervised method** of data training (unlike **PCA which is unsupervised**). Unfortunately, it is significantly harder to implement in Python without the scikit-learn package and most likely will have relatively lower efficiency, therefore I decided to implement PCA as it is more suited towards the context of this assignment.
